    <h4>I LOVE PARIS!</h4>
    <p class="black">"The city of lights, the city of romance," "the culinary capital of the world," this is what Paris is known for. Over seven million people visit each year.Paris, is one of the most amazing places you will ever visit. There are so many phenomenal things to see and do. You will never get bored!</p>
    <p class="black">The most prominent landmark in Paris is the Eiffel Tower. More than seven million people visit the Eiffel Tower each year. For a small fee you can ride the elevator to the top. The view from the top is spectacular. If you want some exercise you can take the stairs that go from the ground to the second platform. Many people like to go to the Eiffel Tower at night because it comes alive with millions of twinkling lights. At night when lit, it is an attractive golden color. The Eiffel Tower took two years to build; it was finished on March 31, 1889. The Eiffel Tower was originally built for the world exhibition in 1889, but today it is used as a radio transmission tower and a tourist attraction. The Eiffel Tower is named after Gustave Eiffel, the main contractor and architect.</p>
    <p class="black">Paris has many museums and Art galleries some of the well known ones are the Louvre, Musee de L'Air et de L'espace and the Musee de L'Orangerie. The Louvre was originally a royal palace but became a museum in 1793. Outside the museum is a substantial glass pyramid. Inside there are many exhibits including artifacts from Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Paris is the culinary capital of the world and is known worldwide for its gourmet cuisine. Some of the best places to eat in Paris include Le Cinq, Taillevent, Restruant Pierre Gagnaire, and L’Astrance. Le Cinq serves classic and contemporary dishes. Restruant Pierre Gagnaire is famous for their innovative dishes that will please both your eyes and your taste buds. L’Astrance is well known in the culinary world for their surprise menu. Once you've tasted the French cuisine you will never get enough of it. I chose to tell you about Paris because it's of the most beautiful cities in the world to visit.</p>
